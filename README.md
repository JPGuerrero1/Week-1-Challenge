# 01 HTML, CSS, and Git: Code Refactor
# Horiseon Week 1 Challenge: HTML and CSS
## Description

The Horiseon webpage was designed to test the limits of one's HTML and CSS understanding. Being given a HTML and CSS file littered with unorganized code, with the task being to organize and streamline the code in the most efficient way possible while still maintaining its function. <br><br/>

## What Problem Did This Challenge Solve?

The task of organizing messy code tests the developers knowledge of how HTML and CSS coexist, and how there are multiple ways to make a webpage, though some ways less efficient than others. It pushes budding developers to their limits in their complex problem-solving ability, creative thinking, and knowledge of HTML and CSS syntax.

## What Was Learned?

This challenge helps developers learn that there is no one right answer to making a functioning webpage, but a streamlined, easy to read code will aid in their understanding of basic HTML and CSS concepts for future projects.
